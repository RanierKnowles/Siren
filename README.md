# Siren
Creation of a simple PCB using KiCAD

I created the two tone / frequency sweeping siren while experimenting with PCB design as part of a college project. Note, this project was bound to the use of the 74HC14 IC.
The schematic for the design can be found on this page.

Required components:

74HC14 Schmitt trigger IC
2 x 1u capacitor,
2 x 10n capacitor,
1 x 330k resistor,
1 x 47k resistor,
1 x 27k resistor,
2 x 1N4148 diode,
1 x buzzer,
1 x switch,

Hope this helps, best of luck annoying your neighbors.
Cheers,
